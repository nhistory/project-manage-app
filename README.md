## Project Management App

An application to manage clients and project data that can make CRUD functionality with simple web page.

- Built backend with expressjs and handled by using graphQL.
- Used graphiql for checking graphql schema on the browser.
- Made cloud-based database by using mongodb atlas and controled with mongodb compass.  

## Initialize application
- initialize project: ```npm init -y``` -> ```package.json``` created
- install dependencies: ```npm i express express-graphql graphql mongoose cors colors``` -> ```node_modules``` folder and ```package-lock.json``` file created.
- install dev mode dependencires: ```npm i -D nodemon dotenv```
- change ```package.json``` scripts setting.

```json
"scripts": {
        "start": "node server/index.js",
        "dev": "nodemon server/index.js"
    }
```
Now you can start server by using ```npm run dev``` command inside of working directory.

## GraphiQL

[GraphiQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphiql) is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). We can make query and check data with GraphiQL on the ```localhost:5000/graphql```.

## Initiate Mongodb - Mongodb atlas, Mongodb compass
### 1. Mongodb atlas

[Mongodb atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_canada_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624311&adgroup=115749704343&gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4oIvFcJ5cjdYixiQOZl9QAf-ot3E0qVDwE8g9m5PAYi_qoTZL4yKvBoCdOwQAvD_BwE) is a cloud-based Mongodb service that don't need to install any program on the local machine.

Sign up with google acount and build a database.

Select share version and create cluster.

Add my local ip address and finish

Create database with own name ```mgmt_db``` and ```clients```.

### 2. Mongodb compass

Download and install [Mongodb compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass). 
On the mongodb atlas, choose overview menu and click ```connect```.

<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39740066/173714243-abaa5f33-180a-43a0-a4ab-1db2abd6dc3a.png">

Select connect to the compass and copy the connection string. And change ```<username>``` and ```<password>```. After that, you can see database connected with atlas on the compass.

To connect with application, select ```go back``` and make a choice ```connect your application```. Copy connection string inside of ```.env``` file as a ```MONGO_URI``` variable. (Change <username>, <password> and add ```mgmt_db``` after ```mongodb.net/``` )

### 3. Connect to the database

By using ```mongoose``` module, you can connect MongoDB with application. Inside of ```config``` folder, ```db.js``` have a ```connectDB``` as a module.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);

  console.log(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`.cyan.underline.bold);
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

If you want to anticipate message as specific color and underline, we can use ```colors``` module.

### 4. Fetch MongoDB data

In order to fetch data from MongoDB after connected with, we need to make new schema for MongoDB again not for GraphQL. In this project, ```Client.js``` and ```Project.js``` file was made inside of ```models``` folder. And changed ```schema.js``` return values of each client and project.

### 5. CRUD client and project with GraphQL and MongoDB
       
For handling MongoDB database with GraphQL, ```mutation``` object type can be added inside of ```schema.js```. Name of object is ```Mutation``` and you can add client data by using GraphiQL like below.
        
<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39740066/173851950-e0af3177-4f97-4a69-ad00-297e51bfb986.png">

And you can find new client data was added successfully on the MongoDB client database with MongoDB compass. Object ID is automatically created by MongoDB.

In the same way, we can add ```deleteClient``` field to delete a client data with GraphiQL on the browser.

```project``` database also can be added, deleted and updated by ustin ```mutation``` object type. This code is added into ```schema.js```.
